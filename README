Thanks to the ongoing heat wave CPU in my laptop reached few times 100°C, almost burning (BIOS shutdown really did rescue me this time), and so a thought about writing program controlling frequency of my CPU accordingly to temperature, decreasing frequency when it is too high (>90°C) and increasing it when it is not too hot (<85°C). And here it is: cpu_temp_governor, currently it works only on 2 core machines with stepping of T3400 (1GHz, 1.33GHz, 1.67GHz and 2.16GHz) and only one thermal sensor. Requires root permissions to run properly.

  To compile just type ./make
  Depends on gprbuild and Ada compiler (probably specifically on GNAT).
